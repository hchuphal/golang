1. Fast compilation - fast build and test
2. Fully compiled - keep in the editor
3. Strongly typed -type checking by the compiler, types needed by users easy to follow
4. Concurrent by default
5. GC - simpler to work but puts performace issues
6. Simplicity is a core value - not easy or trivial but simple
